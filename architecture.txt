RMI to communicate between user clients and front-end server
Front-end server: makes use of both rmi and jgroups
Data should be saved in the 3 replicas(back end servers), not the front-end server
Back-End servers:replicas that each have the data passed from the user clients to the front end server to 
the replicas.

front-end design and implementation left to us.


to send data from front-end to back-end i can create a struct object that holds the data and send this single
object instead of sending every variable one by one 

use send method of jgroups, but add argument for type of data. That way we'll know what the data is for. 
Create everything that is in implementation actually in the backend servers. 
Send an array separated by whitespace , each index is a different auction data
